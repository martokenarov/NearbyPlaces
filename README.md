What I did here:
I used MVVM-C design pattern because I can test easy each part of application.
Each view controller is loading through coordinator. 
Implemented ofline mode and caching through Core Data.

ToDo:
Improvements:
- Adding slider to change distance
- Implementing pagination with nex token

Tests:
- Adding tests for Core Data
- Adding tests for location service
- Adding tests for API client
